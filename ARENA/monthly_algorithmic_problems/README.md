## ARENA Monthly Algorithmic Problems

Each month, [ARENA](https://www.arena.education/) (powered by the amazing [Callum McDougall](https://www.perfectlynormal.co.uk/))
releases a [mechanistic interpretability challenge](https://arena-ch1-transformers.streamlit.app/Monthly_Algorithmic_Problems).

In each monthly challenge, the following are provided:
- An algorithmic task (e.g. sorting a list)
- A dataset for this task (e.g. a dataset of `unsorted_list<SEP>sorted_list` examples)
- A transformer model that has been trained on this dataset, and is capable of performing the algorithmic task

The goal of each monthly challenge is to *understand* and *explain* how the model is performing the algorithmic task.

I have found these challenges to be extremely fun, and a good way of practicing MI techniques.
